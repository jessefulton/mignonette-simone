Simone is a game for the [Mignonette](http://www.mignonette-game.com/) based upon the classic game [Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29) by Milton Bradley.

A series of arrows appear on the Mignonette display which the player must repeat by using the four buttons on the Mignonette hardware. The game continues until a pattern is missed (or I'd imagine it will also stop if the program runs out of memory.)

A video demo is available at vimeo: http://vimeo.com/8741488

### Features

* Three different colors of LEDs!
* Totally rad music and sound effects!
* Big numbers to display your score when you lose!

### Installation

Unzip the file. Open up the makefile and update line 42 with the appropriate programmer. Once that is done, attach the Mignonette and run make program.
